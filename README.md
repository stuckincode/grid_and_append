# grid_and_append

This was part of a course I did on lynda.com with Ray Villalobos to learn JS but I did all the code in jQuery insted because
that is the code I wanted to learn but could not fing a good course on the net to learn what I wanted.

So this is basicaly a grid that when you right click on a picture you get a bigger picture that appears and that also follows 
the mouse.


Major haha moment on this one with offset function.

Has always if you have any comments on the code or know a way to make it better cleaner of to better fallow best practices 
don't hesitate share your thoughts.
